# calculator
<h1>How and why?</h1>
		<p>Why? Well, because it is possible. Essentially, I enjoy taking things to extremes and making things that some people might think are not possible.</p>
		<p>
			How did I do it? Well, it's a mix of using CSS variables, a fitting HTML structure with over 80 checkboxes and labels, calc() for the math, and CSS counters to output things. Have a look at the source code! I promise, there's absolutely zero Javascript. Even this dialog is pure CSS!
		</p>
		<p>PS:  unfortunately Google Chrome doesn't like it when you divide with calc(). It should work according to the specs, but it doesn't. Bummer. 
			Try it in Chrome!</p>
